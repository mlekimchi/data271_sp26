    "# Lab 09: Getting Data from an API and Cleaning the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Lab 09 of Data Wrangling and Visualization!\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "### APIs\n",
    "API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface that software uses to access data, server software, or other applications.  In simple terms, it is a software intermediary that allows two applications to \"talk\" to each other.  They are quite versatile and can be used on web-based systems, operating systems, database systems and computer hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified example would be when you sign into Instagram from your phone you are telling the Instagram application that you would like to access your account. The mobile application makes a call to an API to retrieve your Instagram account and credentials. Instagram would then access this information from one of its servers and return the data to the mobile application.  This is an example of a web API, and will be what we use in this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs depend on the owner of the dataset. The data can be either offered for free or be available at a cost. The owner can also limit the number of requests that a single user can make or the amount of data they can access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Wrangling\n",
    "Broadly, data wrangling can be split into 3 tasks (in no particular order and often repeated):\n",
    "- data cleaning (e.g., renaming columns, reordering, handling duplicates or missing data, filtering to desired subsets)\n",
    "- data transformation (changing the data's structure to facilitate downstream analysis, such as transposing the data, ensuring there is only one observation per row)\n",
    "- data enrichments (e.g., merge new data with the original data by appending new rows/columns or use the original data to create new data).\n",
    "This activity just scratches the surface of this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## In today's lab, we will\n",
    "- Explore an API to find and collect temperature data\n",
    "- Find the city we want\n",
    "- Begin to understand the frequently employed steps in data wrangling and clean the data\n",
    "- Do a small EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, we will collect daily temperature data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) API.  The site is here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2 and is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminsitration (NOAA).  NOAA's mission is to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, ocean, and coasts,to share that knowledge and information with others, and to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources."
