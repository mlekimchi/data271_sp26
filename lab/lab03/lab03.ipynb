    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) can be used for pattern matching in a text editor.  For example, when you use the \"find and replace\" feature in Microsoft Word, you are asking the computer to find specific strings which match a pattern and replace them with another string. We might desire a more flexible way to search and replace. For example, we might wish to locate and replace a word spelled two different ways in a text: serialise and serialize (British and American spelling). The regular expression `seriali[sz]e` matches both \"serialise\" and \"serialize\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples where this flexibilty is useful might be searching for and extracting email addresses from a file.  We know there will be an at sign (@), but don't know what the constraints are in front of it in terms of word length or characters used. It is possible to read through texts and look for patterns using string methods like `split()` and `find()`. However, searching and extracting is so common that there is a powerful library for these tasks (`re`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `re` module provides a set of powerful regular expression facilities, which allows you to quickly check whether a given string matches a given pattern (using the match function), or contains such a pattern (using the search function). A regular expression is a string pattern written in a compact (and quite cryptic) syntax.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The regex describes a pattern to locate in the text, and then we can use specific methods to accomplish tasks.  You can then ask questions such as “Does this string match the pattern?”, or “Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this string?” You can also use regular expression to modify a string or to split it apart in various ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation provides more details: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html."

A codon is a DNA or RNA sequence of 3 nucleotides that encodes a particular amino acid or gives a stop signal.  For DNA, there are three stop codons: TAG, TAA, and TGA.  If we want to match any sequence of DNA terminated by a stop codon, we can use this syntax:\n",
