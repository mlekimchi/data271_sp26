# DATA 271 — Dear Data: A Week of Personal Visualization

---

## What Is Dear Data?

*Dear Data* is a year-long project by data visualization designers **Giorgia Lupi** (Italy) and **Stefanie Posavec** (UK). Every week, they each collected data about their own daily lives, hand-drew a visualization of that data on a postcard, and mailed it across the Atlantic to each other. The catch: neither knew what the other would draw, and the only way to understand a postcard was through a hand-drawn **legend** on the back.

The project asks a deceptively simple question: **what does your life look like as data?**

It's not about perfect graphs or polished software. It's about paying close attention to your own experience — and then inventing a visual language to share it.

## The Assignment

Over the next week, you will become a Dear Data collector. You'll track one aspect of your daily life, hand-draw a visualization of what you find, and share it with your classmates.

This is an **analog, personal, creative** assignment — no laptops required for the main artifact. The goal is not a beautiful chart. The goal is to notice something about your life you might otherwise overlook, and figure out how to show it to someone else.

## Your Timeline

| Day | What to Do |
|---|---|
| **Fri–Sun (this weekend)** | Browse the 8 topic prompts below. Come to Monday's class with **3 topics you'd genuinely want to track** — think about which ones feel surprising, personal, or a little uncomfortable to observe in yourself. |
| **Monday (in class)** | We'll do a quick class vote and narrow the full list to **3 shared topics**. You'll commit to one of the three and begin collecting data today. |
| **Mon–Fri** | Collect data every day on your chosen topic — that's **5 full days**. Don't wait until the end; daily observations are richer than memory. |
| **Fri night / Weekend** | Draw your postcard visualization and write your legend. |
| **Following Monday (in class)** | Gallery walk — share and decode each other's postcards. Turn in your reflection. |

## Step 1: Browse the Topics (This Weekend)

Read through all 8 prompts below and come to Monday's class with **3 topics you'd genuinely want to track**. You don't need to start collecting yet — just notice which ones catch your attention and think about why.

**Good questions to ask yourself:**
- Which topic do I feel slightly nervous about observing closely?
- Which one would I actually be curious to see at the end of a week?
- Which one might reveal something I don't already know about myself?

On Monday, we'll vote as a class and narrow the full list to **3 shared topics**. Everyone will pick one of the three — meaning several of you will be tracking the same thing. That's intentional. The most interesting part of our Friday gallery walk will be seeing how differently each person chose to represent the same data.

## The 8 Topics

---

### 🕐 1. How I Spend My Time
Every hour (or half-hour), log what you're doing and how you'd describe how you feel about it. Categories might include: class, work, eating, socializing, scrolling, sleeping, exercising, commuting, studying.
*Consider tracking:* activity type, duration, mood or energy level, alone vs. with others.

---

### 💬 2. My Conversations
Log every conversation you have that lasts more than ~2 minutes. What was it about? Who with? Where? How did it feel?
*Consider tracking:* topic, medium (in-person, text, phone, video), emotional tone, who initiated it, how long it lasted.

---

### 📱 3. My Screen Time
What are you doing on your phone or computer, and when? You can use your phone's built-in screen time tracker to seed data, or log it manually.
*Consider tracking:* app category, time of day, reason for opening it, how you felt after.

---

### 🍽️ 4. What I Eat and Drink
Track everything you consume — meals, snacks, beverages — over the week.
*Consider tracking:* type of food/drink, time of day, whether it was home-cooked or bought, who you ate with, hunger level, enjoyment.

---

### 😶 5. My Moods
At regular intervals (e.g., morning, afternoon, night), record your emotional state.
*Consider tracking:* mood label or emoji, intensity (1–5), what you think caused it, location, what you were doing.

---

### 🚶 6. How I Move Through the World
Where do you go each day, and how do you get there? What do you notice on the way?
*Consider tracking:* destinations, transportation method, time in transit, whether the journey was routine or new, things you noticed.

---

### 🤔 7. My Decisions
Notice the small and large decisions you make each day — from "what do I eat for breakfast" to "do I go to this event."
*Consider tracking:* decision type, how long it took, how confident you felt, whether you consulted anyone else, how you felt after.

---

### 🎧 8. What I Listen To
Track your music, podcasts, audio — anything you listen to intentionally or in the background.
*Consider tracking:* genre, mood of the content, why you chose it, time of day, what you were doing while listening.

---

## Step 2: Commit to Your Topic (Monday in Class)

After the class vote, you'll choose one of the three selected topics. This is your topic for the week — you'll collect data on it from **Monday through Friday** (5 full days of collection).

## Step 3: Collect Your Data

There is no required format for data collection during the week. Use whatever works for you:

- A small notebook you carry
- A note in your phone
- A simple text file or spreadsheet
- A recurring phone alarm to prompt you

**Tips for good collection:**
- Record in the moment, not from memory at the end of the day
- Capture more detail than you think you'll need — you can always simplify
- Note things that surprise you or feel hard to categorize — those are often the most interesting data points
- Look for both **quantity** (how much, how many, how long) and **quality** (how it felt, what it meant)

---

## Step 4: Draw Your Postcard

At the end of the week, create your visualization **by hand** on a piece of paper approximately postcard size (4×6 inches), or on a larger sheet if you prefer — whichever lets you show your data clearly.

**Your postcard must include:**

1. **A visualization** of your week's data — this can be any visual form you invent. It does not have to be a bar chart. Consider: symbols, shapes, colors, patterns, grids, maps, timelines, spirals, anything.

2. **A legend / decoder** (on the back, or in a corner) that explains how to read your visualization. Someone who has never seen your data should be able to decode it using your legend alone.

**Questions to ask yourself while designing:**
- What do I want someone to notice first?
- What visual variable (shape, size, color, position) best represents this kind of information?
- What surprised me most about my data — can I make that visible?
- Does my legend explain everything a stranger would need to read this?

There are no wrong visual choices here. You are **inventing a visual language**. Be creative, be yourself.

---

## Step 5: Gallery Walk (Following Monday, in Class)

We'll display all postcards in the classroom, grouped by topic. You'll have time to:

- Walk around and try to **decode** your classmates' postcards using their legends
- Spend extra time with postcards that share your topic — what did they track that you didn't? What visual choices did they make that you never considered?
- Leave a sticky note (or verbal comment) on one that surprised or intrigued you

After the walk, we'll discuss as a class: when multiple people track the same thing, why do the visualizations look so different? What does that tell us about data and representation?

This is not a critique — it's a conversation.

---

## Step 6: Written Reflection (Due Monday)

Submit a short written reflection (approximately **200–300 words**) answering the following:

1. **What did you track, and why did you choose it?**
2. **What did you notice or discover that you didn't expect?** (Something your data revealed that surprised you.)
3. **What visual choices did you make, and why?** How did you decide what shapes, symbols, or colors to use?
4. **What was hard to represent?** What aspect of your experience felt difficult or impossible to capture in data?
5. **After the gallery walk:** What did you notice when you saw how a classmate visualized the same topic as you? What did their choices reveal that yours didn't (or vice versa)?

There are no right answers here. This is a space for honest reflection.

## How You'll Be Evaluated

This assignment is graded on **engagement and thoughtfulness**, not artistic skill or technical precision.

| Component | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|---|---|---|
| Data collection | 20% | Five days of real, detailed observations (Mon–Fri) |
| Postcard visualization | 40% | Creative use of visual encoding; legend is clear and complete |
| Gallery walk participation | 20% | Engaged, curious presence; genuine interaction with peers' work |
| Written reflection | 20% | Honest, specific reflection — especially on what was hard to represent |

---

## A Note on Why We're Doing This

Before we dive into tools, software, and datasets, it's worth asking: *what even is data?*

Everything in your life can be observed, recorded, and represented — your habits, your moods, your choices, your movements. Data isn't just something that lives in spreadsheets or databases. It's an abstraction of lived experience.

When you design your own system for encoding that experience visually, you encounter all the fundamental tensions of data visualization: What do you include? What do you leave out? What does the visual form imply that the numbers don't? Who is your audience, and what do you want them to feel?

These questions are at the heart of DATA 271. This assignment is just the beginning of asking them.
